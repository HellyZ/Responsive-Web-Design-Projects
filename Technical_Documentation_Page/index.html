      <strong>Try React</strong>
      <p>React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much React as you
        need. Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to a simple HTML page, or start a complex
        React-powered app, the links in this section will help you get started.</p>
      <strong>Online Playgrounds</strong>
      <p>If you’re interested in playing around with React, you can use an online code playground. Try a Hello World
        template on <a href="https://reactjs.org/redirect-to-codepen/hello-world">CodePen</a>, <a
          href="https://codesandbox.io/s/new">CodeSandbox</a>, or <a
          href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/starter-react-template">Glitch</a>.

        If you prefer to use your own text editor, you can also <a
          href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/master/static/html/single-file-example.html">download
          this HTML file</a>, edit it, and open it from the local filesystem in your browser. It does a slow runtime
        code transformation, so we’d only recommend using this for simple demos.</p>

      <strong>Add React to a Website</strong>
      <p>You can <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html">add React to an HTML page in one
          minute</a>. You can then either gradually expand its presence, or keep it contained to a few dynamic widgets.
      </p>
      <strong>Create a New React App</strong>
      <p>When starting a React project, <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html">a simple HTML
          page with script tags</a> might still be the best option. It only takes a minute to set up!

        As your application grows, you might want to consider a more integrated setup. There are <a
          href="https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html">several JavaScript toolchains</a> we recommend for
        larger applications. Each of them can work with little to no configuration and lets you take full advantage of
        the rich React ecosystem.</p>
      <strong>Learn React</strong>
      <p>
        People come to React from different backgrounds and with different learning styles. Whether you prefer a more
        theoretical or a practical approach, we hope you’ll find this section helpful.
        <ul>
          <li>If you prefer to learn by doing, start with our <a
              href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html">practical tutorial.</a></li>
          <li>If you prefer to learn concepts step by step, start with our <a
              href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html">guide to main concepts.</a></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <strong>First Examples</strong>
      <p>The <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React homepage</a> contains a few small React examples with a live editor.
        Even if you don’t know anything about React yet, try changing their code and see how it affects the result.</p>
      <strong>React for Beginners</strong>
      <p>If you feel that the React documentation goes at a faster pace than you’re comfortable with, check out <a
          href="https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-react/">this overview of React by Tania Rascia</a>. It
        introduces the most important React concepts in a detailed, beginner-friendly way. Once you’re done, give the
        documentation another try!</p>
      <strong>React for Designers</strong>
      <p>If you’re coming from a design background, <a href="https://reactfordesigners.com/">these resources</a> are a
        great place to get started.</p>
      <strong>JavaScript Resources</strong>
      <p>The React documentation assumes some familiarity with programming in the JavaScript language. You don’t have to
        be an expert, but it’s harder to learn both React and JavaScript at the same time.

        We recommend going through <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript">this JavaScript
          overview</a> to check your knowledge level. It will take you between 30 minutes and an hour but you will feel
        more confident learning React.
        <blockquote>
          <strong>Tip: </strong> Whenever you get confused by something in JavaScript, <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">MDN</a> and <a
            href="https://javascript.info/">javascript.info</a> are great websites to check. There are also <a
            href="https://reactjs.org/community/support.html">community support forums</a> where you can ask for help.
        </blockquote>
      </p>
      <strong>Practical Tutorial</strong>
      <p>If you prefer to learn by doing, check out our <a href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html">practical
          tutorial</a>. In this tutorial, we build a tic-tac-toe game in React. You might be tempted to skip it because
        you’re not building games — but give it a chance. The techniques you’ll learn in the tutorial are fundamental to
        building any React apps, and mastering it will give you a much deeper understanding.</p>
      <strong>Step-by-Step Guide</strong>
      <p>If you prefer to learn concepts step by step, our <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html">guide to
          main concepts</a> is the best place to start. Every next chapter in it builds on the knowledge introduced in
        the previous chapters so you won’t miss anything as you go along.</p>

    <article>
      <p>React is a JavaScript library, and so we’ll assume you have a basic understanding of the JavaScript language.
        If you don’t feel very confident, we recommend <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript">going through a
          JavaScript tutorial</a> to check your knowledge level and enable you to follow along this guide without
        getting lost. It might take you between 30 minutes and an hour, but as a result you won’t have to feel like
        you’re learning both React and JavaScript at the same time.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <strong>Note:</strong> This guide occasionally uses some of the newer JavaScript syntax in the examples. If you
        haven’t worked with JavaScript in the last few years, <a
          href="https://gist.github.com/gaearon/683e676101005de0add59e8bb345340c">these three points</a> should get you
        most of the way.

  <section class="main-section" id="Introducing_JSX">
    <header>Introducing JSX</header>
    <article>
      <p>
        Consider this variable declaration:
        <code>const element = &lth1&gtHello, world!&lt/h1&gt</code>
        This funny tag syntax is neither a string nor HTML.

        It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to describe what
        the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of
        JavaScript.

        JSX produces React “elements”. We will explore rendering them to the DOM in the next section. Below, you can
        find the basics of JSX necessary to get you started.</p>

      <strong>Why JSX?</strong>

      <p>React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled,
        how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.

        Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">separates concerns</a> with loosely coupled units
        called “components” that contain both. We will come back to components in a <a
          href="https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html">further section</a>, but if you’re not yet
        comfortable putting markup in JS, this talk might convince you otherwise.

        React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the
        JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.

        With that out of the way, let’s get started!</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Rendering_Elements">
    <header>Rendering Elements</header>
    <article>
      Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps.

      An element describes what you want to see on the screen:
      <code>const element = &lth1&gtHello, world&lt/h1&gt;
      </code>

      Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects, and are cheap to create. React DOM takes care of
      updating the DOM to match the React elements.
      <blockquote><strong>Note:</strong>

        One might confuse elements with a more widely known concept of “components”. Elements are what components are
        “made of”, and we encourage you to read this section before jumping ahead.</blockquote>
      <strong>React Only Updates What’s Necessary</strong>
      <p>React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM updates necessary
        to bring the DOM to the desired state.</p>
    </article>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Components_and_Props">
    <header>Components and Props</header>
    <p>
      Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. This
      page provides an introduction to the idea of components. You can find a <a
        href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html">detailed component API reference here.</a></p>

    <blockquote>
      <strong>Note:</strong>
      Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return
      React elements describing what should appear on the screen.</blockquote>
    <strong>Function and Class Components</strong>
    <p>The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function:</p>
    <code>function Welcome(props) {
      return &lth1&gtHello, {props.name}&lt/h1&gt;
      }</code>
    <p>This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single “props” (which stands for properties) object
      argument with data and returns a React element. We call such components “function components” because they are
      literally JavaScript functions.

      You can also use an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes">ES6 class</a>
      to define a component:</p>
    <code>class Welcome extends React.Component {
      render() {
      return &lth1&gtHello, {this.props.name}&lt/h1&gt ;}
      }</code>
    <p>The above two components are equivalent from React’s point of view.

      Classes have some additional features that we will discuss in the next sections. Until then, we will use function
      components for their conciseness.</p>
    <strong>Rendering a Component</strong>
    <p> Previously, we only encountered React elements that represent DOM tags:
      <code>const element = &ltdiv /&gt ;
      </code>
      However, elements can also represent user-defined components:
      <code>const element = &ltWelcome name="Sara" /&gt ;
      </code>
      When React sees an element representing a user-defined component, it passes JSX attributes to this component as a
      single object. We call this object “props”.

      For example, this code renders “Hello, Sara” on the page:
      <code>
        function Welcome(props) {
        return &lth1>Hello, {props.name}&lt/h1&gt ;
        }

        const element = &ltWelcome name="Sara" /&gt ;
        ReactDOM.render(
        element,
        document.getElementById('root')
        );
      </code>
    </p>
    <strong>Composing Components</strong>
    <p>
      Components can refer to other components in their output. This lets us use the same component abstraction for any
      level of detail. A button, a form, a dialog, a screen: in React apps, all those are commonly expressed as
      components.

      For example, we can create an App component that renders Welcome many times:
      <code>
        function Welcome(props) {
        return &lth1&gtHello, {props.name}&lt/h1&gt ;
        }

        function App() {
        return (
        &ltdiv&gt
        &ltWelcome name="Sara" /&gt
        &ltWelcome name="Cahal" /&gt
        &ltWelcome name="Edite" /&gt
        &lt/div&gt
        );
        }

        ReactDOM.render(
        &ltApp /&gt,
        document.getElementById('root')
        );
      </code>
    </p>
    <strong>Extracting Components</strong>
    <p>Don’t be afraid to split components into smaller components.

      For example, consider this Comment component:
      <code>
        function Comment(props) {
        return (
        &ltdiv className="Comment"&gt
        &ltdiv className="UserInfo"&gt
        &ltimg className="Avatar"
        src={props.author.avatarUrl}
        alt={props.author.name}
        /&gt
        &ltdiv className="UserInfo-name"&gt
        {props.author.name}
        &lt/div&gt
        &lt/div&gt
        &ltdiv className="Comment-text"&gt
        {props.text}
        &lt/div&gt
        &ltdiv className="Comment-date"&gt
        {formatDate(props.date)}
        &lt/div&gt
        &lt/div&gt
        );
        }
      </code>

    </p>
    <strong>Props are Read-Only</strong>
    <p>Whether you declare a component <a
        href="https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#function-and-class-components">as a function or a
        class</a>, it must never modify its own props. Consider this sum function:</p>
    <code>
      function sum(a, b) {
      return a + b;
      }
    </code>
    <p>Such functions are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">“pure”</a> because they do not
      attempt to change their inputs, and always return the same result for the same inputs.

      In contrast, this function is impure because it changes its own input:</p>

    <code>function withdraw(account, amount) {
      account.total -= amount;
      }</code>
    <p>React is pretty flexible but it has a single strict rule:</p>
    <strong>All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.</strong>
    <p>
      Of course, application UIs are dynamic and change over time. In the next section, we will introduce a new concept
      of “state”. State allows React components to change their output over time in response to user actions, network
      responses, and anything else, without violating this rule.

      <p>React is, in our opinion, the premier way to build big, fast Web apps with JavaScript. It has scaled very well
        for us at Facebook and Instagram.
        One of the many great parts of React is how it makes you think about apps as you build them. In this document,
        we’ll walk you through the thought process of building a searchable product data table using React.</p>
      <strong>Start With A Mock</strong>
      <p>Imagine that we already have a JSON API and a mock from our designer. The mock looks like this:</p>
      <img src="https://reactjs.org/static/thinking-in-react-mock-1071fbcc9eed01fddc115b41e193ec11-4dd91.png"
        alt="mock">
      <p>Our JSON API returns some data that looks like this:</p>
      <code>[
        {category: "Sporting Goods", price: "$49.99", stocked: true, name: "Football"},
        {category: "Sporting Goods", price: "$9.99", stocked: true, name: "Baseball"},
        {category: "Sporting Goods", price: "$29.99", stocked: false, name: "Basketball"},
        {category: "Electronics", price: "$99.99", stocked: true, name: "iPod Touch"},
        {category: "Electronics", price: "$399.99", stocked: false, name: "iPhone 5"},
        {category: "Electronics", price: "$199.99", stocked: true, name: "Nexus 7"}
        ];</code>
      <strong>Step 1: Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy</strong>
      <p>The first thing you’ll want to do is to draw boxes around every component (and subcomponent) in the mock and
        give them all names. If you’re working with a designer, they may have already done this, so go talk to them!
        Their Photoshop layer names may end up being the names of your React components!

        But how do you know what should be its own component? Just use the same techniques for deciding if you should
        create a new function or object. One such technique is the single responsibility principle, that is, a component
        should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.

        Since you’re often displaying a JSON data model to a user, you’ll find that if your model was built correctly,
        your UI (and therefore your component structure) will map nicely. That’s because UI and data models tend to
        adhere to the same information architecture, which means the work of separating your UI into components is often
        trivial. Just break it up into components that represent exactly one piece of your data model.</p>

        alt="mock-2">
      <p>You’ll see here that we have five components in our simple app. We’ve italicized the data each component
        represents.
        <ol>
          <li>FilterableProductTable (orange): contains the entirety of the example</li>
          <li>SearchBar (blue): receives all user input</li>
          <li>ProductTable (green): displays and filters the data collection based on user input</li>
          <li>ProductCategoryRow (turquoise): displays a heading for each category</li>
          <li>ProductRow (red): displays a row for each product</li>
        </ol>
        If you look at ProductTable, you’ll see that the table header (containing the “Name” and “Price” labels) isn’t
        its own component. This is a matter of preference, and there’s an argument to be made either way. For this
        example, we left it as part of ProductTable because it is part of rendering the data collection which is
        ProductTable’s responsibility. However, if this header grows to be complex (i.e. if we were to add affordances
        for sorting), it would certainly make sense to make this its own ProductTableHeader component.

        Now that we’ve identified the components in our mock, let’s arrange them into a hierarchy. This is easy.
        Components that appear within another component in the mock should appear as a child in the hierarchy:
        <ul>
          <li>FilterableProductTable
            <ul>
              <li>SearchBar</li>
              <li>ProductTable
                <ul>
                  <li>ProductCategoryRow</li>
                  <li>ProductRow</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
