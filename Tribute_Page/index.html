          <strong>LOST GODS</strong> 
          <p>With Lost Gods, Brom’s gritty and visceral prose takes us on a haunting, harrowing journey into the depths of the underworld. Thrust into a realm of madness and chaos, where ancient gods and demons battle over the dead, and where cabals of souls conspire to overthrow their masters, Chet plays a dangerous game, risking eternal damnation to save his family.</p>

          <strong>KRAMPUS</strong>
          <p>One Christmas Eve in a small hollow in Boone County, West Virginia, struggling songwriter Jesse Walker witnesses a strange spectacle: seven devilish figures chasing a man in a red suit toward a sleigh and eight reindeer. When the reindeer leap skyward taking the sleigh, devil men, and Santa into the clouds, screams follow. Moments later, a large sack plummets earthward, a magical sack that will thrust the down-on-his luck singer into the clutches of the terrifying Yule Lord, Krampus. But the lines between good and evil become blurred as Jesse’s new master reveals many dark secrets about the cherry-cheeked Santa Claus, and how half a millennium ago, the jolly old saint imprisoned Krampus and usurped his magic.</p>

          <strong>THE DEVIL'S ROSE</strong>
          <p>Damnation is a road littered with pain, sorrow, and regret. None know this better than the man who rides that track everyday: Cole McGee, a once proud Texas Ranger, now condemned to hunt Hell's fugitives across the plains of both the living and the dead. But today Cole's luck might've changed. Something has escaped the deepest pits of damnation. Hell wants this something back at any cost and has offered Cole redemption in exchange for its apprehension. Sounds like a good deal to Cole, but as he closes in on his quarry he begins to realize you should never bargain with the Devil.</p>

          <strong>THE PLUCKER</strong>
          <p>Brom intimately combines his dramatic storytelling with his uniquely arresting images, to create a work of striking imagination, a world where fairy-tale tradition collides with vileness and depravity, love and heroism, suffering and sacrifice. A shadowy land of make-believe where Jack and his box are stuck beneath the bed with the dust, spiders, and other castaway toys, forced to face a bitter truth: children grow up and toys are left behind. Jack believes this is the worst that can happen to a toy.</p>
